The values are related to the storage conntainers through the assignment operator (=). Note, the assignment operator does not show equality! To show equality, we use the 'equals' operator, which looks like this (==). More on the assignment operator, the equals operator and other operators can be found in my article on operators.\n",

Isn't it easier to type 9 + 10 than boys + girls? True, but in the real world, data is large and complicated. Remembering large numbers like 28409204 and 82108409 will be a pain in the neck; not to mention, the data may keep changing. Therefore, in the long run, it is easier to store data in variables and compute them using variable names.\n",
