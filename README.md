This repo contains my personal summary notes on python for data science. Full notes can be found in my series of articles in hashnode called
[Easy as .py](https://codelikegreg.hashnode.dev/series/easy-as-py).
I'm working on one very long article called Python 101 for data science. I'll link it here as soon as it drops.

Hoping this repo takes you from beginner to expert 🤞🏾😆
